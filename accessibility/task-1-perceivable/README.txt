issues which have been fixed:

notice: after fixing the alt issues in the images, I have tested the page against the light house and chrome screen reader.

general:
1. the institute logo misses alt tag

example 1:
1. in the image tag, it misses the alt property.

example 2:
1. the list of products has enough information, so I have used null alt property.
2. the bar image does not convey any useful information so I have used a null alt tag.
3. the image tag inside the a tag (link), misses the alt property.

example 3:
1. I have described the image which is a chart. 

example 4:
1. I have added an alt property to the first image, and associated others with null alt property.
