    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <h3>Happy Easter!</h3>
    <p>
      The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a
      folkloric figure and symbol of Easter, depicted as a rabbit bringing
      Easter eggs. Originating among German Lutherans, the "Easter Hare"
      originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were
      good or disobedient in behavior at the start of the season of Eastertide.
      (Wikipedia: Easter Bunny, online March 2020:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Bunny" title="Easter Bunny"
        >Easter Bunny</a
      >)

    <p>
      The Easter Bunny is sometimes depicted with clothes. In legend, the
      creature carries colored eggs in his basket, candy, and sometimes also
      toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to Santa
      Claus or the Christkind, as they both bring gifts to children on the night
      before their respective holidays.
